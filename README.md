# Fitness Tracker App


## Description:
With this Budget Tracking app, you can add deposits/withdrawals and our app will keep a balance of everything you've entered with a running total! 

If you do happen to lose connection to the internet, the data you enter will be stored into an offline database and will update your budget when you get back online!
